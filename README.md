# Hey, I'm Florian Elmhorst 👋
I'm an interaction designer and frontend developer with a passion for creating engaging digital experiences. With an eye for visual design and a good technical understanding, I combine the best of two worlds and bring a unique perspective to every project I undertake.

I also enjoy writing clean code, because as a wise man once said:
> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. (Martin Fowler)
